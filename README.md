# Pluralsight C# Learning Path

Code samples and hands-on exercises based on the [C# Learning Path on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/csharp), structured as individual subfolders for each course.

This monorepo reflects my progress through the learning path and serves as both a personal reference and practical reinforcement of the core C# concepts.
